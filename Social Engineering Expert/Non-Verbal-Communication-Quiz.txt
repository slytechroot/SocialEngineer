    Micro Expressions are subtle involuntary facial gestures (ie: Fear, Surprise, Disgust) that quickly reveal how a person is feeling or reacting to a situation.
    2.

    There's a saying that goes, "The lips tell lies, but the body tells the truth." Micro Expressions are the most often concealed gestures by people. Their faces may be stern, but their bodies wiggle with anxiety. To the trained eye, this is an advantage. Watch the person's body language for hints toward their true feelings!
    3.
    Knowing how to skillfully read the body language of others can be useful to manipulate others by falsifying yours
    True! Targets can be manipulated with body language alone, by a trained social engineer. Body language tactics must accompany every face-to-face operation with purpose and intent. Just like Clothing, Props and First Line Responses, so too should body language be part of that equation!
