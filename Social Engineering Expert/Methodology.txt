    Defined Scope, Rules of Engagement and A Plan are all required for the preparation (and success) of a social engineering operation.
    2.
    The Social Engineering Operational Plan is to be used only by the social engineering team.
    The Social Engineering Operational Plan is the culmination of the Scope and Rules of Engagement. It spells out details, goals and functions of the team and is to be shared with the client, not just the social engineering team.

    It is never okay to stray out of scope without permission. Period. In the industry we call that being a "cowboy." You don't want to be a cowboy, unless you're actually a cowboy. 
    If an opportunity presents itself to be beneficial to the client and the action is out-of-scope, make a quick call to obtain permission. Otherwise, make note of the vulnerability and refrain from breaking the rules.
