 You answered 4 out of 4 questions correctly

    1.
    Usernames and passwords should the the primary target for Spear Phishing
    Usernames and password should not be the only target for social engineering testing. Whichever type of data that is most important and closely-held to the client (customer list, code, intellectual property), must be the targeted data. While usernames and passwords often make the list, they must not be the ONLY targeted data.
    2.
    Most data breaches begin with spear phishing
    True. About 91% of data breaches begin with spear phishing.
    3.
    Always ask directly for sensitive information first from the target
    False. Never ask for sensitive information directly, unless there have been multiple attempts to obtain it indirectly without success. Asking for sensitive information has a high likelihood to put the target on high alert and become very suspicious. 
    Instead, leverage decoy websites where you can direct targets to ask them to complete a form and indirectly collect such information without directly asking for it.
